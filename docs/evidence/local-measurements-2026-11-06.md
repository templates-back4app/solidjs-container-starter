# Local measurements — SolidJS (Vite) container starter — 2026-11-06

## Environment

- Machine: Apple Silicon Mac (arm64), macOS (Darwin 25.5.0)
- Container runtime: Docker CLI 29.9.3 with colima (macOS Virtualization.framework).
  Note: the plan said "Docker Desktop", but Docker Desktop was not installed on this
  machine; `brew install colima docker` + `colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8` was used
  instead. Image sizes and build behaviour are identical; wall times may differ
  slightly from Docker Desktop.
- Host Node: v25.8.1, npm 11.11.0 (the Docker build stage uses node:22-alpine)
- Date: 2026-11-06

## Method notes (apply to every number below)

- The scaffold does not ship a `package-lock.json`, so `npm install` was run once to
  generate it (the lockfile is committed; the Dockerfile's `npm ci` needs it), then
  `node_modules` was deleted and `npm ci` timed with `/usr/bin/time -p` (warm npm cache).
- `npm run build` timed the same way; the "real" line is the wall time.
- `docker build` wall times are with the base images (node:22-alpine, nginx:1.27-alpine)
  already pulled. The very first build on a clean machine also pulls both bases
  (observed: 56.3 s total for the first build of the day vs ~8-10 s after).
- First-load JS: container run with `docker run --rm -p 8491:8080 <image>`, `/` fetched,
  every `<script src>` in the HTML fetched with
  `curl -s -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' -o /dev/null -w '%{size_download}'`, bytes summed.
- nginx gzip: the stock `gzip_comp_level` default (1) transferred ~14-18 % more bytes
  than the build tool's reported gzip sizes; this repo's nginx.conf sets
  `gzip_comp_level 6`, and the numbers below are measured with level 6.
- Port 8090 was busy on this machine; measurements used host port 8491. If curl returns
  a page that is not your app, check `lsof -nP -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN` first.

## Scaffold

    npm create vite@latest solidjs-container-starter -- --template solid

Versions (package.json): solid-js ^1.9.18, vite ^8.3.6, vite-plugin-solid ^2.11.15.

## Numbers

| Measurement | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| npm ci | `/usr/bin/time -p npm ci` | **1.43 s** (75 packages) |
| npm run build | `/usr/bin/time -p npm run build` | **2.47 s** wall (Vite: "built in 503ms") |
| dist size | `du -sk dist` | **76 KB** |
| docker build | `/usr/bin/time -p docker build -t solidjs-container-starter .` | **8.31 s** (bases already pulled) |
| image size | `docker images` | **76 MB** |
| HTML document gzipped | `curl -s -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' -o /dev/null -w '%{size_download}' http://localhost:8491/` | **475 bytes** |
| First-load JS gzipped | `/assets/index-CDaOe7bN.js` (only script referenced) | **5,665 bytes** (raw 15.03 kB) |

With nginx's default `gzip_comp_level 1` the bundle transferred 6,183 bytes;
nginx.conf sets `gzip_comp_level 6`.

Verified: SPA fallback returns 200 on deep routes; `/assets/*` served with
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
